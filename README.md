# Hangman 🎯

A classic Hangman game built in Python — guess the word one letter at a time before you run out of lives!

## 🔹 Features
- Word list with mixed difficulty (6-letter words)
- ASCII art-based Hangman visuals
- Input validation & repeat guess alerts
- Modular file structure (`hangman.py`, `hangman_word.py`, `hangman_art.py`)

## 📂 Files
- `hangman.py` — Main game logic
- `hangman_word.py` — Word list
- `hangman_art.py` — Logo and hangman stage drawings

## 🧠 How to Play
1. Run the `hangman.py` file
2. Guess one letter at a time
3. You have 6 lives — each wrong guess draws a part of the hangman
4. Win by guessing the full word before you're out of lives!

## ▶️ Run It
Make sure all three files are in the same folder. Then in terminal:

```python
python hangman.py

# 📌 Example Output
Guess a letter: e
_ e _ _ _ _
```
